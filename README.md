# Color Generator :art:

A simple color generator application using [React.Js](https://reactjs.org/). This Application won't give you any autometic color but it's give you `41` different color suggestion that you want.

See live : [ColGen](https://mhhabib.github.io/ColorGen/)

### When it can be used?

Sometimes you need a color to design your webpages. Suppose, you need a red color to design a specific point of your website and put there the red color but it doesn't look good. Then put your red color(rgb code) in this application and it will give `41 different` color suggestions. Choose your favorite one to design your application with perfect color.

#### Used library

I used [Values.js](https://github.com/noeldelgado/values.js) to get the hexacolor format.

#### To get the source code

Clone [this repository](https://github.com/mhhabib/ColorGen) then open commnand promt in your download folder. type `cd ColorGen` and then run `npm start`.
